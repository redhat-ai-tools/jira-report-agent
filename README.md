# Agent Template

This repository provides a robust and flexible template for building AI agents. Whether you're developing intelligent assistants, automated workflows, or complex decision-making systems, this template offers a solid foundation to accelerate your development process. It's designed for easy setup, clear organization, and extensibility, allowing you to focus on the core logic of your agents.

## Features

- **Modular Structure**: Organize your agent's components logically for better maintainability.
- **Easy Configuration**: Manage agent settings and parameters with a straightforward configuration system.
- **Extensible Design**: Easily add new tools, behaviors, and integrations to your agents.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Basic setup for tracking agent activities and debugging.
- **[Supports Multi-Step Reasoning Agents]**: Add specific use case examples here.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your own agent project up and running using this template.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.9+ (or your specific required version)
- pip (Python package installer)
- [Any other prerequisites, e.g., Docker, specific OS libraries]

## Usage

This section guides you on how to use the template to develop and run your agents.

### Running a Sample Agent

To run the included sample agent:
```bash
python main.py
```
(Adjust `main.py` if your primary entry point is different.)

### Creating Your Own Agent

1. **Define your agent's logic**:
   - Update the system prompts for your agent's specific logic and define its behavior, tools, and objectives.

2. **Configure your agent**:
   - Modify the configuration files (e.g., `deployment.yaml`) to define your agent's parameters, models, and tools.

3. **Integrate tools**:
   - Implement or integrate external tools that your agent can use to interact with the environment (e.g., web search, API calls, database access).
