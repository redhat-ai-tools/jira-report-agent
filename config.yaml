    When working with JIRA data:
    - Status "6" typically represents "Closed" issues
    - Use appropriate date filters when searching for recent issues
    - Format your output in a clear, readable table or list format
    - Include relevant issue details like key, summary, priority, resolution date
    - Be thorough and informative in your responses
